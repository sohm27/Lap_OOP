Question: 

- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. 
  Does JAVA allow you to do this? 
Answer: JAVA does not allow us to do that because the java allow overloading methods only if they have the different signatures which are:
-Having the different number of arguments
-Or having same number of arguments but different arguments datatype
And the constructor title and category have the same number of arguments(1) but they have the same different arguments datatype String
So JAVA will not allow us to do that.
