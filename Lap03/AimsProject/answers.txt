Question:Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a pass by Reference programming language?
Answer:Teachnically,Java is always pass by value progamming language
Question:After the call of swap(jungleDVD,cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Answer:Because when we pass a variable as an argument to a method in Java, a copy of the value of that 
variable is made and passed to the method. Changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original
variable outside the method.So the swap(jungleDVD,cinderellaDVD) does not change the state title of the object jungleDVD 
Question:After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD,cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed
Answer:Because in this changeTitle method we explicitly change the state title of the object jungleDVD but not itself
